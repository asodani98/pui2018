          <div class="overlay1">
            <div class="text1"> This is the view from St. Paul's Cathedral and is one of my favorites in London. The climb of 528 steps is definitely worth it.
            Looking at this picture, you would probably think this is taken during the winter, but in fact it is in the middle of summer, guess London just always looks dreary.</div>

                <div class="text2">This was my first time making it over to Sky Garden and it was absolutely breathtaking. You can walk
                around the entire circumference and essentially see the whole of London.</div>

                <div class="text5">You can't come to England and not experience an Afternoon Tea. They have many different ones and it is definitely worth it.
                This was my second experience and we went to a Science themed one. It was all about the show!

                my favorite sites in the city. While standing on this bridge, it made me realize
                why I love London - it is a city that brings the world together.</div>
