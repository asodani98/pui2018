            <div class="text1">The Taj Mahal is situated in Agra, India. In Arabic, it means "crown of palaces". It was built by 22,000 laborers and took 17 years to complete. When I was in India, trying to get the picture symmetrical took me almost 30 minutes, and it still wasn't perfect.</div>

                <div class="text2">The meal displayed in this image is Paneer Makhani and it is one of my favorite Indian dishes to eat. India is called the land of spices because no other place produces as many spices as India.</div>

                <div class="text3">If you visit India, there is a 99% chance you will walk into a Temple. Hindus pray at Temples and believe in idol worship. There are many important rituals that take place
                in a temple and many customs, such as ringing the bell as you enter a temple, that are followed worldwide.</div>

                <div class="text6">What I love most about India is the retention of culture that is clearly visible everywhere you go. For example, the namaste which is the folding of
                hands towards your elders to showcase respect is followed all over India regardless of income levels. Even though I grew up in Dubai, I still learned all the same
                traditions as my cousins who live in India.</div>
