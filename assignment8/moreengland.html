          <div class="overlay1">
            <div class="text1"> This is the view from St. Paul's Cathedral and is one of my favorites in London. The climb of 528 steps is definitely worth it.
            Looking at this picture, you would probably think this is taken during the winter, but in fact it is in the middle of summer, guess London just always looks dreary.</div>

                <div class="text2">This was my first time making it over to Sky Garden and it was absolutely breathtaking. You can walk
                around the entire circumference and essentially see the whole of London.</div>

                <div class="text5">You can't come to England and not experience an Afternoon Tea. They have many different ones and it is definitely worth it.
                This was my second experience and we went to a Science themed one, so everything was based off molecular food or used nitrogen ice in its making. It was all about the show, but the taste
                was most certainly forgotten.

                <div class="text4">This is what I saw on my last day in London and I just stood on the bridge, watching the sunset and looking over the River Thames at
                my favorite sites in the city. While standing on this bridge, many different people from different cultures and backgrounds passed by me and it made me realize
                why I love London - it is a city that brings the world together.</div>
