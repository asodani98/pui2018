            <div class="text1">The sunsets in Thailand were absolutely beautiful, I had never seen so many colors in one sky before. What was even more beautiful was how the crystal clear water would reflect the colors making you feel like you were submerged in it yourself.

                <div class="text2">This was one of the many shops that sells knock off designer brands. I found this very interesting to capture because there were so many tourists who would wander
                into these shops and come out carrying multiple bags.</div>

                <div class="text3">A huge part of the trip was FOOD. We had everything from home cooked meals to fancy restaurant meals to street side vendors. Every time the flavors
                were a little different. My favorite meals were the curries we tried as there was a level of depth in each one due to the spices mixed into it.

                <div class="text4">Overall, Thailand has been one of my favorite vacations ever, because I was just met with so many surprises. I was surprised by how
                welcoming the people were, how good the food was, and how unbelievably beautiful the place was regardless that most of its population lived under $5
                a day.</div>
